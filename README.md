### Shell scipting
Shell scripting is a powerful way to automate tasks in a Linux environment. It allows you to execute
a series of commands in a script, making your workflow more efficient.

A <mark> shell </mark> is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for the Unix/Linux operating system.
It allows users to execute commands, run programs, and manage system resources. 

Common shells include:
• **Bash** (Bourne Again Shell): The default shell on most Linux distributions.
• **Zsh** (Z Shell): An extended version of Bash with additional features.
• **Ksh** (Korn Shell): Known for its scripting capabilities.
• **Tcsh**: An enhanced version of the C shell (csh), with scripting improvements.

Usually, *shells* are interactive, which means they accept commands as input from users and execute
them. However, sometimes we want to execute a bunch of commands routinely, so we have to type in all
commands each time in the terminal. As a shell can also take commands as input from file, we can write
these commands in a file and can execute them in shell to avoid this repetitive work. These files are called
Shell Scripts or Shell Programs. So, Shell Scripting is the process of writing a series of commands in a
file (script) to automate tasks. These scripts can perform complex tasks like file manipulation, program
execution, and printing text.
